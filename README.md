# Welcome!
I'm Varun - data enthusiast, programmer, and musician from Massachusetts. I completed my MS in Computer Science from Boston University in Janujary 2024. It was an incredible experience and I had the fortune of learning from several talented professors. On my website, you can find my current [portfolio](https://www.varun.pro/#/portfolio), which includes many of the projects I completed in school along with other fun side projects. Please feel free to [email me](mailto:vanadgir@gmail.com) to get in touch!
