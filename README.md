# Welcome!
I'm Varun - data enthusiast, programmer, and musician from Massachusetts. Right now, I am wrapping up a Masters in Computer Science at BU Metropolitan College and expect to graduate in January 2024. It's been an incredible experience and I've had the fortune of learning from several talented professors. On my website, you can find my current [portfolio](https://www.varun.pro/projects.html), which includes many of the projects I completed in school along with other fun side projects. Please feel free to [email me](mailto:vanadgir@gmail.com) to get in touch!
