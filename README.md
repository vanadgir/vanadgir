# Welcome!
I'm Varun - data enthusiast, programmer, and musician from Massachusetts. Right now, I am pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at BU Metropolitan College to explore research opportunities and expand my portfolio. On my website, you can find my current [portfolio](https://www.varun.pro/projects.html) along with other fun side projects. Please feel free to [email me](mailto:vanadgir@gmail.com) to get in touch!
