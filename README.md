# Welcome!
I'm Varun, programmer and musician from Massachusetts. I'm currently looking for work as an analyst or developer and you can find me tinkering on interesting projects here in the meantime!

### Background

On my personal website, you can find my [portfolio](https://www.varun.pro/projects) and [blog](https://www.varun.pro/blog). At the moment, I am re-learning some Java and documenting my journey with the Processing application, and I intend to move over to p5.js once I have a better handle of creative coding.
